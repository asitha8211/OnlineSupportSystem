## About Online support system

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- cd to Backend
- Please do run ``php artisan migrate`` after configuring database
- Please do run ``php artisan db:seed`` after configuring database
- Can create support agent from ``php artisan online_support_system:support_agent example@email.com --create`` from console command and login
- I have used Laravel, Mysql, Javascript mainly for development.
- I used homestead environment manage both frontend and backend.
- Please do a ``npm install`` from frontend and ``composer install``backend
